		<h2>For a large part of my life I’ve been affected by something that I really haven’t thought about in depth until recent years. I acknowledge how I’ve been privileged enough to live with brown skin without needing to think how it’s impacted me and led me to who I am today. It’s still something that’s impacted me internally, and silently affected my personal identity.</h2></br>
	<h2 class="fill">I can’t imagine a life any different.<h2>

		<h2>Recently the world has blown up, speaking up about the issues of <span class="b">racism</span> and how the systems that we live in promote <span class="b">inequality</span> and <span class="b">injustice</span>. It’s an issue that <span class="b">bleeds</span> into the minds of many people of color and has slowly caused change in culture over the centuries that this issue has existed. Beautiful cultures are being slowly and quietly <span class="b">erased</span> in a country that prides itself on being a “melting pot” and a place that is a promise-land of diversity and equality. There are many forces that have been used to reinforce this inequality, and it affects people of color and several other minority groups in many ways whether they speak out or remain silent, and this needs to be acknowledged.</h2>
		
		<h2 class="fill">This is my story, and my experience.</h2>

		<h2>I recently asked my mother who is an immigrant from Mexico if she had ever experienced any racism. She shared with me a story that I wasn’t even aware of until I had asked.  Many years ago she went to a Church and was told by the Pastor that, “Mexicans <span class="b">don't</span> <span class="b">know</span> <span class="b">how</span> <span class="b">to</span> <span class="b">respect</span> the House of God.”</h2>
		
		<h2 class="fill">Imagine entering a space where you're promised peace, hope, and safety, only to be made to feel as though you aren't welcome.</h2>

		<h2>When my brothers and I were younger, my mother refrained from putting us in ESL classes in elementary school. She was told from a friend that putting us in that program would only <span class="b">set</span> <span class="b">us</span> <span class="b">back</span> in our learning. We never got a proper opportunity to learn Spanish in our home, or even in school. To this day I cannot speak Spanish fluently, but I understand it well.</h2>
		
		<h2 class="fill">Imagine visiting relatives and not knowing how to clearly communicate with people that you should love.</h2>
	</div>
			
	<div>
		<h2>As a teenager, I would wear sweaters during the heat of the summer to avoid getting <span class="b">darker</span>. Even though my skin is naturally dark, I didn’t want to be any darker. I never really thought about why, but there was a part of me that felt as though having dark skin <span class="b">isn't</span> <span class="b">ideal.</span></h2>
		
		<h2 class="fill">Imagine being ashamed of something that you can’t change.</h2>

		<h2>When I moved to Chicago, I went to Pilsen because I heard of the food and the culture that it held as a Latinx neighborhood. I was excited to go to a neighborhood that held homely food, and residents that I can relate to and understand. Instead I found myself entering restaurants and struggling to communicate with the servers, or walking down the street and not knowing whether to greet people with “hello” or “hola.” I discovered that my definition and experience of being latinx was <span class="b">much</span> <span class="b">different</span> than what others knew. Even though my skin color was the same, I felt <span class="b">out</span> <span class="b">of</span> <span class="b">place.</span></h2>
		
		<h2 class="fill">Imagine entering a space where you feel like you should belong, only to find that you’re not like anyone there at all.</h2>
	</div>
			
	<div>
		<h2 class="fill">As I’ve grown to build an identity for myself and understand who I am, I’ve reflected on these experiences. I don’t view them as struggles, but I view them as something that has quietly shaped who I identify as. I now feel <span class="y">proud</span> to live in this skin that I wear, and I am <span class="y">proud</span> of the person that I am, the things that I do, and what it means to be <span class="y">me.</span></h2>
